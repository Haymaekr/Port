          <p>In a human being, electrical activity of neurons produces currents spreading through the head. These currents reach the surface of the scalp, in the form of voltage changes and magnetic fields, both of which can be measured non-invasively. This measured voltage changes at the scalp are called the Electroencephalogram (EEG) and the measured magnetic fields at the scalp are called the Magneto-Encephalogram (MEG). There are diseases of the nervous system that gradually cause the bodyâ€™s movement to not function properly. Eventually causes total paralysis. While patients with Locked-in syndrome lose complete control of the majority of voluntary muscles, their cognitive functions are usually unaffected. However, extraocular muscles often retain their function, allowing patients to potentially communicate through eye movements and blinking. In recent years, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have emerged as a method to enable patients with the locked-in syndrome to interact with the external world. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a technique to detect neural activity and has been widely used in conjunction with BCIs, due to its non-invasive nature, accessibility, affordability and fine temporal resolution. EEG-based BCIs mainly use three signals: P300 wave, steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) and motor imagery (MI). In particular, one does not require external stimulus to generate MI, allowing the users to control external devices at free will. When users execute real movements or imagine movements (during a motor imagery task), there will be suppression of the mu rhythm (7-13Hz).</p>
          <p>The brain computer interface can provide the communication facility by using only the brain waves. The common brain computer interface system uses EEG electrodes for signal acquisition system. The brain generated electrical signal is acquired by these electrodes. The ionic current which flows in the neurons are measured through the electrons present on the scalp. The acquired signal is pre-processed by the series of filters and amplifiers. A high gain instrumentation amplifier is used because the EEG signals has very less energy which is in micro-volts. The filters used are selected as per the requirement of the processing system. For an activity of brain while sleeping, thinking, moving body parts, concentrating etc. various band of frequencies are generated. Brain generates the auditory and visual stimuli through the signals it is called as steady state evoked potential</p>
          <p>For a completely disabled person the features used are slow cortical potential, sensorimotor rhythm potential and event related potential. Depending on the concentration of the human brain the speed of the wheelchair can increase the performance. By Fourier Transformation the feature extraction of signal is done. The statistical analysis is used with the wavelet transform for comparison of the two signals for classification purpose. The brain signal can be categories as band of frequency such as Alpha (7 to 13 Hz), Beta (12 to 20 Hz) and Gamma (20 to 45 Hz).</p>
